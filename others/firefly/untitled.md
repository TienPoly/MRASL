The `firefly_blue` has been flashed with a special firmware on the high level containing a Luenberger observer fusing incoming pose information with the onboard IMU. This allows `firefly_blue` to be controlled using the Vicon system.

The `firefly_green` is not currently available. **NOW available**

## Frequenctly Asked Questions

### Wifi keeps dropping out, what gives?

The firefly has an Intel 7260 Wifi adapter and there are a lot of complaints online about instability issues. Try adding to `/etc/modprobe/iwlwifi.conf` the following:

```text
options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8
```

This should turn on link aggregation and has worked once in the past.

### I'm connected to Wifi but I can't ping anything in the network

Check how you configured your network adapters. Clearpath sent us the Fireflys with a static IP on the \(always on\) ethernet adapter. This allows ROS to work even when not connected to a network. If this IP is on the same subnet as the Wifi adapter, all your packets will go through your unplugged ethernet.

To get around this see our [networking page](/Equipment/Networking/LAN.md) on dealing with multiple interfaces on the same subnet.
